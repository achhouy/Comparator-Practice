# Comparator-Practice
The purpose of this programming project is to demonstrate a significant culmination of most constructs learned thus far in the course. 
This includes Lists, Classes, accessors, mutators, constructors, implementation of Comparable, Comparator, use of Collections sort, 
iterators, properly accessing fields of complex objects, and fundamental File I/O.
